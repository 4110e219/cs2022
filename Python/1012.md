# [Python Lists](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_lists.asp)

# [BASIC LIST OPERATIONS]
- Lists are used to store multiple items in a single variable.
``` python
thislist = ["taiwan", "canada", "south korea"]
print(thislist)

- Allow Duplicates - since lists are indexed, lists can have items with the same value:
``` python
thislist = ["pencil", "paper", "ruler", "paper", "scissor"]
print(thislist[1])
print(thislist) 

- List Length- to determine how many items a list has, use the len() function: 
``` python 
thislist = ["taiwan", "canada", "south korea"]
print(len(thislist[2]))

- List items can be of any data type:
``` python 
list1 = ["oppo", "samsung", "iphone"] 
list2 = [2, 4, 6, 8, 3]
list3 = [True, True, False]

print(list1)
print(list2)
print(list3)

- type() - From Python's perspective, lists are defined as objects with the data type 'list':
``` python 
mylist = ["taiwan", "canada", "south korea"]

print(type(mylist)) 

- It is also possible to use the list() constructor when creating a new list. 
``` python 
thislist = list(("ghana", "almond", "joya"))
print(thislist)

# [Python - Access List Items]
-Access Items- list items are indexed and you can access them by referring to the index number:
``` python 
thislist = ["strawberry", "orange", "grapes"]
print(thislist[1])

-Negative indexing means start from the end
-1 refers to the last item, -2 refers to the second last item etc.
thislist = ["taiwan", "canada", "south korea"]
print(thislist[-3])

- Range of Indexes - You can specify a range of indexes by specifying where to start and where to end the range.
``` python 
thislist = ["grapes", "banana", "cherry", "orange", "kiwi", "melon", "mango"]
print(thislist[1:6])

#This will return the items from position 1 to 6.

#Remember that the first item is position 0,
#and note that the item in position 6 is NOT included


- Range of Negative Indexes - Specify negative indexes if you want to start the search from the end of the list:
``` python 
thislist = ["grapes", "banana", "cherry", "orange", "kiwi", "melon", "mango"]
print(thislist[-5:-2])

#Negative indexing means starting from the end of the list.

#This example returns the items from index -5 (included) to index -2 (excluded)

#Remember that the last item has the index -2,

- Check if Item Exists - to determine if a specified item is present in a list use the in keyword:
``` python 
thislist = ["taiwan", "canada", "south korea"]
if "taiwan" in thislist:
  print("Yes, 'taiwan' is in the country list")
  
# [Python - Change List Items]
-Change Item Value - to change the value of a specific item, refer to the index number:
``` python 
thislist = ["joana", "marie", "garcia"]
thislist[2] = "tirano"

print(thislist)
